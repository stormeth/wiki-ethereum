## Status

### Spurious Dragon

The fourth major live release of Ethereum aka Spurious Dragon was released in Nov 2016. Development continues towards the versions named Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Spurious Dragon is aiming for [Ðapp developers](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Dapp-Developer-Resources) as well as end users for limited categories of applications, and has a number of security enhancements compared to previous versions, and the upcoming Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ).

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit the Ethereum homepage over at [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](http://paper.gavwood.com/). See the [development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki) and [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon),
